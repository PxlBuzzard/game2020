# One-way platform physics

## A second physics object

Create a small box on the player's head. If that makes contact, the player does not collide with the CollisionBox until the main physics body stops making contact.

## Use Y velocity

If Y velocity is >0, the player does not collide with the CollisionBox until the main physics body stops making contact.
