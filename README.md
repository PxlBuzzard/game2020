# Game2020

This game was created by Daniel Jost using [Hex Engine](https://hex-engine.dev/). I don't claim that this is fun or complete in any way, it was an experiment for a couple weeks to use a React-like library to code a game. Assets were created by [Kenney](https://kenney.itch.io/) and used here with a Creative Commons Zero license.

## Unique features for a Hex Engine game

-   [Player camera](src/Camera.ts)

### OGMO Editor integration

[Ogmo Editor](https://ogmo-editor-3.github.io/) is a simple open source level editor. Without a level selector in the game yet, you can change the level in the [Root component](src/Root.ts).

## Development

To run a development webserver for this locally:

```sh
npm start
```
